<h1>Part 1: Vertigo</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create shots with the vertigo effect we modified our distance to subject and zoom.</li>
  <li>We started far and zoomed in and ended up close and zoomed out</li>
  <li>this kept the subject in focus + looking static while the background changes</li>
</ul>

<h1>Part 2: Fake Miniatures</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>we manually determined a focus line through the image</li>
  <li>we altered the "depth of field" of the image by blurring around the focus plane</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Points further from the focus line were blurred more. This was done by applying a gaussian blur with a low sigma (0.5) iteratively and expanding the region around the focus line that gets affected by the blur.</li>
    <li>we defined the size of the fake depth of field by how big the region around the focus line getting blurred should be (we set a threshold and expanded it each iteration</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
