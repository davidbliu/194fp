<h1>Work in Progress: Final Project</h1>
<h2>David Liu and Simon Wu</h2>

<h1>Project 1: Vertigo</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create shots with the vertigo effect, we simultaneously changed both
  the camera's distance from the subject and its zoom.</li>
  <li>The camera started near the subject while zoomed out, and moved farther
  while zooming in.</li>
  <li>This kept the subject in focus and appearing stationary while the
  background changed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cone</h2>
<div id = 'cone-pics'></div>
<h2>Simon</h2>
<div id = 'simon-pics'></div>
<h2>Bells and Whistles: Animated GIFs</h2>
<img src = './results/coneVertigo.gif'/>
<img src = './results/simonVertigo.gif'/>
<h2>Bells and Whistles: Moving Subject and Camera</h2>
<p>Next we tried moving the subject instead of the camera. While Simon moved
away from the camera, the stationary camera zoomed in to keep him in the same
position. The effect of this was similar to the vertigo effect, with the
background changing behind the subject.</p>
<div id = 'still-pics'></div>
<img src = './results/stillVertigo.gif'/>
<p>We also tried capturing two subjects simultaneously: Simon and the cone.
While the cone stayed in place, the camera moved away as in the traditional
vertigo effect, and Simon moved in the opposite direction. The result looks
pretty cool.</p>

<h1>Project 2: Fake Miniatures</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The user manually determines a horizontal focus plane through the
  image.</li>
  <li>We altered the "depth of field" of the image by blurring it around the
  focus plane.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Points farther from the focus plane were blurred more. This was done
    by iteratively applying a Gaussian blur with sigma=1 to the image while
    shrinking the affected bands with each step.</li>
    <li>The size of the plane selected to remain in focus determined the
    effective "depth of field" of the resulting image.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Lastly, we significantly increased the saturation of the image to make
  it look more surreal, like an actual toy miniature.</li>
</ul>
